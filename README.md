# Community fly.io Terraform provider

This was forked from the [original provider](https://github.com/fly-apps/terraform-provider-fly) in an attempt to mantain it via the community.

I'm not actively using Fly at the moment - I'll try to fix things if I have time, but otherwise I hope I'll be prompt in reviewing and merging PRs.

## Terraform Registry - andrewbaxter/fly

Terraform resources are documented on the Terraform Registry, published to [andrewbaxter/fly](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/zakhar-gulchak/fly/latest/docs).

## Contributions

My only request is try not to change more than is necessary in a PR (i.e. leave formatting alone, if there are multiple unrelated changes turn them into multiple MRs, etc).

Also unless it's a one or two line fix, it may be worth making an issue to discuss the fix first. There's a large backlog of refactoring this could use (ex: use `superfly/fly` client library, update graphql definitions, etc) and if you start doing one thing it may snowball. Talking things through first we may be able to come up with a plan to make incremental changes.

## Tips for adding functionality

Fly uses two APIs simultaneously: the old GraphQL API and the new "Machines" REST API (it also deals with apps, volumes, etc).

If you run the provider with `TF_LOG=DEBUG` it'll log all http requests for both GraphQL and REST queries (note that terraform messes with the escaping so it may be more of a rough approximation of what's sent).

You can compare requests to what `flyctl` does for the same operations. I cloned it and made the following changes locally to get it to do the same logging:
